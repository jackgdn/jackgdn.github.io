      <description>After several days of work, I have completed the basic migration of my personal blog from Hexo to Hugo. I was using Hexo-Theme-Async theme previously. Both Hexo and Hugo have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of Hexo is its simplicity. Without complex operations can anyone construct a pleasing blog with Hexo. Meanwhile, Hugo excels in speed of generation and high customization capabilities.&#xA;In terms of generation speed, running hugo server command is significantly faster than running hexo g and hexo s combined.</description>
