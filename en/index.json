I was using Hexo-Theme-Async theme previously. Both Hexo and Hugo have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of Hexo is its simplicity. Without complex operations can anyone construct a pleasing blog with Hexo. Meanwhile, Hugo excels in speed of generation and high customization capabilities.\nIn terms of generation speed, running hugo server command is significantly faster than running hexo g and hexo s combined. Additonally, Hugo's hot reload mode surpasses that of Hexo's. Whenever I make a change to an article, Hugo directly displays modified contents, whereas using Hexo requires regeneration with its slow generation speed... Clearly, Hugo is superior to Hexo.\nThis theme supports multi-language versions, and I am taking this opportunity to learn terminologies of CST. After the transition to Hugo, the previously delicate archive and friend page have disappeared. Interactive website titles and icons, as well as various interesting widgets, can no longer be used. In their place is a simpler and more business-oriented blog theme. In the coming weeks, I will aim to translate several blog posts and integrate password and comment plugins into the blog.\n","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/post/log-2024-08-06/","section":"post","tags":["Log"],"title":"Log-2024-08-06"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/categories/logs/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Logs"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":" Undergraduate student at NEFU, majoring in CST.\n","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/tags/linear-mathematics/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Linear Mathematics"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/tags/mathematics/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Mathematics"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/categories/mathematics/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Mathematics"},{"body":"Vandermonde matrix：\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix}1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ x_1 \u0026amp; x_2 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n \\\\ x_1^2 \u0026amp; x_2^2 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^2 \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_1^{n-1} \u0026amp; x_2^{n-1} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^{n-1} \\end{vmatrix} = \\prod_{n \\ge i \u0026gt; j \\ge 1}(x_i-x_j) $$\nThe proof is as follows：\nStarting at line $n$, subtract $x_1$ times the previous line from the subsequent line in the determinant to obtain the following equation:\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2-x_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n-x_1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n(x_n-x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2^{n-2}(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^{n-2}(x_n-x_1) \\end{vmatrix}\\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\\\ = \\begin{vmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2-x_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n-x_1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n(x_n-x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; x_2^{n-2}(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^{n-2}(x_n-x_1) \\end{vmatrix} $$\nExpanding the resulting determinant by the $1$th line.\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} x_2-x_1 \u0026amp; x_3-x_1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n-x_1 \\\\ x_2(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; x_3(x_3-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n(x_n-x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_2^{n-2}(x_2-x_1) \u0026amp; x_3^{n-2}(x_3-x_1) \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^{n-2}(x_n-x_1) \\end{vmatrix} \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\\\ = (x_2-x_1)(x_3-x_1) \\cdots (x_n-x_1) \\begin{vmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ x_2 \u0026amp; x_3 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_2^{n-2} \u0026amp; x_3^{n-2} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n^{n-2} \\end{vmatrix} $$\nAt this point the right end of the equation is a Vandermonde matrix of order $n-1$, which can be written as\n$$ (x_3-x_2)(x_4-x_2) \\cdots (x_n-x_2) \\begin{vmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ x_3 \u0026amp; x_4 \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_n \\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_3^{n-3} \u0026amp; x_4^{n-3} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; x_3^{n-3} \\end{vmatrix} $$\nAccording to mathematical induction, the Vandermonde matrix can be written:\n$$ (x_2-x_1)(x_3-x_1) \\cdots (x_n-x_1)(x_3-x_2)(x_4-x_2) \\cdots (x_n-x_{n-1}) \\\\ \\ \\\\ \\ \\\\ = \\prod_{n \\ge i \u0026gt; j \\ge 1}(x_i-x_j) $$\nQ.E.D.\n","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/post/%E8%8C%83%E5%BE%B7%E8%92%99%E5%BE%B7%E8%A1%8C%E5%88%97%E5%BC%8F%E8%AF%81%E6%98%8E/","section":"post","tags":["Linear Mathematics","Mathematics"],"title":"Proof of Vandermonde Matrix"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
