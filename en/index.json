I was using Hexo-Theme-Async theme previously. Both Hexo and Hugo have their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of Hexo is its simplicity. Without complex operations can anyone construct a pleasing blog with Hexo. Meanwhile, Hugo excels in speed of generation and high customization capabilities.\nFirst, in terms of generation speed, running hugo server command is significantly faster than running hexo g and hexo s combined. Additonally, Hugo's hot reload mode surpasses that of Hexo's. Whenever I make a change to an article, Hugo directly displays modified contents, whereas using Hexo requires regeneration with its slow generation speed... Clearly, Hugo is superior to Hexo.\nRegarding customization, I am currently using the hugo-clarity theme, which does not provide a position for an external music player link. Consequently, I customized a shortcode to directly embed the following external music player in this article:\nHere, I customized a shortcode named ncm.html with the following template content:\n1{{ $src := .Get \u0026#34;src\u0026#34; }} 2{{ $width := .Get \u0026#34;width\u0026#34; }} 3 4\u0026lt;iframe frameborder=\u0026#34;no\u0026#34; border=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginwidth=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginheight=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;{{ $width }}\u0026#34; height=86 src=\u0026#34;{{ $src }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; Subsequently, I obtained the embed code for this track from Netease Cloud Music and made some slight modifications before inserting it into this Markdown document.\nEmbed code:\n1\u0026lt;iframe frameborder=\u0026#34;no\u0026#34; border=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginwidth=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginheight=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; width=530 height=86 src=\u0026#34;//music.163.com/outchain/player?type=2\u0026amp;id=2062178646\u0026amp;auto=0\u0026amp;height=66\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; Inserted code:\n1\u0026lt;ncm frameborder=\u0026#34;no\u0026#34; border=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginwidth=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; marginheight=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; width=530 height=86 src=\u0026#34;//music.163.com/outchain/player?type=2\u0026amp;id=2062178646\u0026amp;auto=0\u0026amp;height=66\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This theme supports multi-language versions, and I am taking this opportunity to learn terminologies of CST. After the transition to Hugo, the previously delicate archive and friend page have disappeared. Interactive website titles and icons, as well as various interesting widgets, can no longer be used. In their place is a simpler and more business-oriented blog theme. In the coming weeks, I will aim to translate several blog posts and integrate password and comment plugins into the blog.\n","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/post/log-2024-08-06/","section":"post","tags":["Log"],"title":"Log-2024-08-06"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/categories/logs/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Logs"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":" Undergraduate student at NEFU, majoring in CST.\n","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://jackgdn.github.io/en/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
